More seriously, I have chosen to start accepting donations. &nbsp;If you like the program,
and have the funds to spare, feel free to make a donation of any amount using the "Donate" button on this
form. &nbsp;You will have to be online in order to make a donation.

Now, for the credits. &nbsp;This project was based on source code for a
screensaver posted at <a href="http://www.elouai.com" target="_blank">http://www.elouai.com</a>.
&nbsp;Much thanks should go to the original author not only for creating such a nifty program, but also
for freely distributing the source code, thus allowing code-monkeys like myself to tinker with it.
&nbsp;All modifications to that originally
posted source were done by me, Happy Dude.&nbsp; The 'Matrix Code Font' currently bundled with the program
is produced by <a href="http://e-rbi.com/" target="_blank">e-RBi</a>. &nbsp;Finally, the installer was
created using <a href="http://www.wintax.nl/isx/" target="_blank">Inno Setup Extensions</a>, and the HTML help
documentation (and the homepage itself) was preprocessed with
<a href="http://www.cabaret.demon.co.uk/filepp/" target="_blank">Filepp</a>.
</p>

<p>
To check for updates to the program, visit the <a href="http://zmatrix.n3.net" target="_blank">homepage</a>,
and compare the program version listed at the top of this form with the program version listed on the
homepage.

<p>
In order to help me deal with the volume of incoming mail, I am
asking that users please review the help documentation that comes with ZMatrix
before reporting problems/asking for support.&nbsp; Failing that, I ask users
to try to submit feedback via the following web interfaces:
</p>

<table border="1">
	<tr>
		<th>Type of Feedback</th>
		<th>Appropriate Web Interface</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
		Program crashes, error messages, unexpected behaviour.
		<font color="FF0000"><b>
		&nbsp; If you report a bug, please leave some sort of contact information (email or ICQ/MSN/Yahoo messenger handle) with the bug report.
		&nbsp; If I am unable to reproduce the problem on my own machine, and cannot contact you, I am not likely to be able to fix the bug.
